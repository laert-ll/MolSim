# Lines of comment start with '#' and are only allowed at the beginning of the file
# Empty lines are not allowed.
# The first line not being a comment has to be one integer, indicating the type of data
# represented in the file.
# - '0' stands for particle data
# - '1' stands for cuboid data
# - '2' stands for disc data
#
# The second line indicates the number of data sets (e.g. number of particles or cuboids).
#
# The third line indicates the dimension of the simulation.
#
# Disc data consists of
# * coordinates of the disc center (3 double values)
# * start velocities of all particles in the disc (3 double value)
# * number of particles along the radius of the disc (1 integer value)
# * distance ( = meshwidth between the particles) (1 double value)
# * mass of the particles (1 double value)
