# Empty lines are not allowed.
# The first line not being a comment has to be one integer, indicating the type of data
# represented in the file.
# - '0' stands for particle data
# - '1' stands for cuboid data
#
# The second line indicates the number of data sets (e.g. number of particles or cuboids).
#
# Cuboid data consists of
# * coordinates of lower left front corner (3 double values)
# * number of particles per dimension (3 size_t values)
# * distance between particles (1 double value)
# * mass of a particle (1 double value)
# * initial velocities of particles per dimension (3 double value)
# * mean velocity of the Brownian Motion (1 double value)
